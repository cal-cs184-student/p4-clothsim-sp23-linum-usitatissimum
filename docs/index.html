              <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
              <p>
                  There are two main parts to this project. In the first part, we simulated the physics behind cloth kinematics and created a system that can simulate how a piece of fabricated cloth can interact with itself and other objects in a scene, while in the second part we wrote GLSL shaders to render the cloth in different interesting manners.
              </p>

              The first part was divided into 4 main steps:
              <ul>

                  <li>
                      The first step was constructing the basic particle based model of the fabric. We constructed this model by creating a mesh with particles and different types of springs that connected the particles, creating a elastic model of the fabric that we can later simulate real world physics with.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                      We then implemented the basic interactions between this basic mesh and external forces, namely gravity in our case. With every particle, we exerted gravity on each of them and reflected that by giving them a change in speed, acceleration, as well as displacement. We used the Verlet Integration to approximate this calculation. Then, since we want the fabric to retain its shape and not deform too drastically, we corrected the two point masses' positions such that the spring's length is at most 10% greater than its resting length.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                      The third step was to update the interaction between the cloth and objects in the scene. To do this, we perform interaction tests on all of the points' previous position and current position, and see if they have crossed an object's surface. If so, we fix this faulty displacement by moving the current position to the outside of the object.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                      The last step was to process self-collision. Since colliding each cloth particle with one another is extremely costly, we create a hash function that would use the particle's position to generate a key that maps to a vector of particle, where the key covers a small box of the 3D space. The vector of particles that the key maps to is then all the particles covering that space. Only particles sharing a key will be compared to see if they collide, which saves a lot of execution resources. This allows us to simulate self-collision in a more managable amount of time.
                  </li>


              </ul>

              <p>
                  The second part of the project was more straightforward. For each different shader, we simply use the simulation algorithm for each of the light effects in each shader's corresponding .frag file, and copied the rendered value to the output variables. For displacement shader, we also modified the .vert file so that it can edit the vertex locations in accordance to the displacement map to reflect a varying height for each vertex to represent the displacement on the materials. 
              </p>

              <ul>
                  <li>
                      NoShearing:We ran the cloth simulation using the pinned2.json scene and disabled the shearing constraints in the Cloth::simulateFrame function in cloth.cpp. The resulting wireframe displayed the cloth structure held together by the structural and bending springs, which maintain the cloth's shape and prevent it from stretching too much. The absence of shearing constraints allows for more flexibility in the cloth's deformation.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                      OnlyShearing:In this case, we disabled the structural and bending constraints, leaving only the shearing constraints active. The cloth wireframe now exhibits a more flexible structure, as the shearing springs allow the cloth to deform diagonally. This results in a more realistic representation of how a cloth would behave in a real-world setting.


                  </li>

                  <li>
                      WithAllConstraints:Finally, we enabled all the constraints (structural, shearing, and bending) in the Cloth::simulateFrame function. This wireframe represents the most comprehensive and accurate cloth simulation, incorporating all three types of constraints to provide a balance between rigidity and flexibility. The cloth behaves realistically, maintaining its shape while also deforming and bending as expected.
                  </li>

              </ul>

              <p>
                  By taking screenshots of the cloth wireframe under these different constraints, we can demonstrate how the point masses and springs work together to simulate the behavior of a cloth. The comparison of the wireframes also helps in understanding the role each type of constraint plays in the overall simulation.

                      The effects of changing the spring constant ks: A very low ks value results in a cloth that is more elastic and less stiff. The cloth will stretch more under the influence of gravity, and it may take longer to reach a stable state.A high ks value makes the cloth stiffer and less elastic. It will stretch less under the influence of gravity and reach a stable state more quickly.

                  <li>
                      For density:A lower density makes the cloth lighter, which results in less deformation under gravity and potentially faster stabilization.
                      A higher density makes the cloth heavier, causing it to deform more under gravity and potentially take longer to reach a stable state.

                      For damping:A lower damping value will cause the cloth to oscillate more before settling into its resting state, as there is less energy loss in the simulation.
                      A higher damping value will cause the cloth to settle more quickly, as more energy is lost due to friction and heat during the simulation.

              <p>
                  With lower density and lower ks, the cloth appears more elastic and loosely folded, as the lower stiffness allows for larger deformations and less resistance to self-collision.
                  With higher density and higher ks, the cloth appears stiffer and maintain its structure more effectively, leading to smaller folds and a more rigid appearance.
                  A combination of low/high density and high/low ks can produce varying behaviors that demonstrate the cloth's responsiveness to changes in these parameters.

              <h3>
                  Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
              </h3>

              <p>
                  A shader program is a set of specialized programs that run on a GPU, designed to manipulate vertex and pixel data to create various visual effects, such as lighting, texturing, and shading. Vertex shaders and fragment shaders work together in a shader program to generate these effects. The vertex shader processes individual vertices and can manipulate their position, color, and other attributes. The fragment shader, also known as the pixel shader, calculates the final color of each pixel based on the output from the vertex shader and other inputs, such as textures, lights, and material properties.
              </p>

              <h3>
                  Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
              </h3>

              <p>
                  The Blinn-Phong shading model is a lighting model that approximates the appearance of surfaces by combining ambient, diffuse, and specular components. Ambient lighting represents the base level of light in the scene, independent of any light sources. Diffuse lighting depends on the angle between the surface normal and the light direction, simulating the scattering of light on a matte surface. Specular lighting creates shiny highlights on surfaces, depending on the angle between the viewer and the reflection of the light source. Provide screenshots of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, only the diffuse component, only the specular component, and using the entire Blinn-Phong model.

You can either provide your own texture or use one of the ones in the textures directory, BUT choose one that's not the default texture_2.PNG. Compare the two approaches and resulting renders in your own words. Compare how your the two shaders react to the sphere by changing the sphere mesh's coarseness by using -o 16 -a 16 and then -o 128 -a 128.

              <p>
                  For this part, we exchanged the names of given textures 2 and 3 to generate a different rendering result from the bump/displacement shaders. Below is a side by side comparison of both shaders:

              <p>
                  Then, we compared the render results with different coarseness of the sphere mesh. While this does not have a signficant impact on the bump shader, it does change the way the displacement are calculated in the displacement shader. When the sphere mesh is less coarse, the render result is "smoother" with less details of the displacement texture map, while more details are rendered when the sphere mesh is more coarse.
